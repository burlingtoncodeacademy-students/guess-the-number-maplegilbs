1.  ASK user to play a game - store response as variable.  
1a. Validate the response.  Make lowercase for use in conditional..
1b. Check if PLAYGAME is 'y' OR 'n' if not ask again until response is 'y' or 'n'
1c. Test the variable PLAYGAME (conditional) if 'y' start if 'n' exit.

2.  Establish a range - ASK for a minimum store response as variable MIN
2a.  Validate response - confirm TYPEOF is NUMBER if not ask until (LOOP) TYPEOF is a NUMBER
2b.  ASK for a maximum store response as variable MAX
2c.  Validate response - confirm TYPEOF is NUMBER if not ask until (LOOP) TYPEOF is a NUMBER

3. ASK user to input a number in that range store as variable SECRETNUMBER
3a. Validate response - if TYPEOF is not a Number OR number > max OR < min, ask again until (LOOP) conditions are met

4. Make guess (call guessing function)

5. (Now in guessing function) given parameters min and max, guess in the middle of the range (BINARY SEARCH)
5a.  Declare variable GUESS as min + max / 2 rounded (down or up does not matter)
5b. Return GUESS

6. (Back in main function) ASK user if the number is the GUESS.  Store response ISCORRECT as variable.
6a. Validate the response.  Make lowercase for use in conditional..
6b. Check if  ISCORRECT 'y' OR 'n' if not ask again until response is 'y' or 'n'
6c. If ISCORRECT is 'y' celebrate and exit the game
6d. If ISCORRECT is 'n' ASK user if the number is higher or lower than GUESS;
6e. If
